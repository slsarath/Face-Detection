Face Detection

Course Computer Vision

Recognize, identify and classify faces within images using CNN and image recognition algorithms. In this hands-on project, the goal is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.
